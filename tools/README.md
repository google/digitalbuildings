# Digital Buildings Tools

Various tools have been developed to support the use of the Digital Buildings Ontology and Building Configuration files. 

The tools and their functions are summarized below:
  * [ABEL](./abel/README.md) generates from a Google Sheets spreadsheet to a [Building Configuration YAML file](../ontology/docs/building_config.md) (and vice versa).
  * [Explorer](./explorer/README.md) allows users to explore the ontology types and their associated fields.
  * [Instance Validator](./validators/instance_validator/README.md) allows users to validate a concrete instance of the ontology (i.e., a building configuration file).
    * A sub-function of the Instance Validator is to also validate telemetry messages for each reporting entity in the building configuration file using [Telemetry Validator](./validators/instance_validator/README.md#telemetry-validation).
  * [Ontology Validator](./validators/ontology_validator/README.md) allows users to validate a local version of the YAML ontology upon a change or an extension.

## Digital Buildings Toolkit

The Digital Buildings Toolkit provides a centralized method for interfacing with the following Digital Buildings tools:
  * Instance Validator (with optional telemetry validation)
  * GUID generator

There are currently two methods for interacting with the Toolkit: the Toolkit Web Application (currently in alpha) and the Toolkit Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Toolkit Web Application

The [web-based toolkit application](dbo-toolkit-app.azurewebsites.net) exists to provide a user-friendly interface to all of the Digital Buildings tools. 

**Note:** Currently, the Toolkit Web Application only supports the Instance Validator. The team plans to support other tools in the near future.

### Toolkit CLI Installation

To install please follow the instructions below.

#### Create a Virtual Environment

First, create a virtual environment with `venv` followed by the environment name (in this example: `tooling`) in the `digitalbuildings` repository.

```
python -m venv tooling
```


#### Activate the Virtual Environment

Mac OS / Linux:
```
source tooling/bin/activate
```

Windows
```
tooling\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install Packages
Next, you can either use pip or setup (to be deprecated) to install the necessary packages and dependencies.

##### Install Pip
1. Run the following command to ensure that your Python package management tools are up-to-date.

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

2. Run `bash pip_install.sh` (MacOS / Linux) or `pip_install.bat` (Windows) from the following directory: `digitalbuildings/tools`.

##### Install Docker (Optional)

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
2. Run `./tools/docker_run.sh` to build the docker image.
3. All tools can now be called by passing the tool name and arguments to `./tools/docker_run.sh`, for example, to run ABEL:
```
$ ./tools/docker_run.sh abel
```

##### Run Setup (to be deprecated)

1. Follow setup instructions for the [Instance Validator](./validators/instance_validator).
2. Follow setup instructions for the [GUID Generator](./guid_generator).
3. Run `sudo python setup.py` for this directory.

##### Authentication

To Authenticate against GCP PubSub for telemetry validation you must install 
and initialize the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). 
Then, use the 
[gcloud auth application-default-login](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login)
command to create credentials for default logins.

### Toolkit CLI Workflow

Run `python toolkit.py` and provide the following arguments:

1. `--input` or `-i`: The absolute filepath of a building configuration file(.yaml).

2. `--modified-types-filepath` or `-m` **[Optional]**: Validates entity types in the building configuration file against a modified ontology (i.e., a local branch) that is not in the main repository. Default is the [Digital Buildings Ontology](https://github.com/google/digitalbuildings/tree/master/ontology/yaml).

3. `--generate` or `-g`: Generates GUIDs for entities in the building configuration file. Since the instance validator expects the [new building configuration format](https://github.com/google/digitalbuildings/blob/master/ontology/docs/building_config.md#new-format), this option also converts a building configuration from the old format to the new format.

4. `--validate` or `-v`: Runs instance validator to validate the building configuration file.

5. [Optional] Telemetry Validation: After a building configuration's entity 
   types are validated, validation must also be run on the telemetry payload 
   using the following parameters. **NOTE:** The  subscription (`-s`) is 
   provided by the Google team. Please reach out to your IoT TPM for guidance.

   * `--subscription` or `-s`: The fully-qualified path to a Google Cloud Pubsub subscription (e.g., `projects/google.com:your-project/subscriptions/your-subscription`).
 
   * `--timeout` or `-t` **[Optional]**: The timeout duration in seconds for the telemetry validation test. The default value is 600 seconds, or 10 minutes. If this time limit is exceeded before the validator receives a test pubsub message for each of the entities configured in the given instance config file, the test will fail with an error and report the entities that were not heard from.

 6. `--report-directory` or `-d` **[Optional]**: Writes instance validation(instance_validation_report.txt) and telemetry validation (telemetry_validation_report.json) reports to the specified `report-directory`. By default, writes instance validation output to the console and telemetry validation output to the current working directory.

 7. `--udmi` **[Optional]**: Validates entity metadata as [UDMI](https://github.com/faucetsdn/udmi/). Flag is set to `True` by default; change this parameter to `--udmi=False` when not validating against UDMI.

For example, the following input

```
python toolkit.py -i //path/to/building/configuration/file.yaml -g -v -s subscription-name -c //path/to/oauth/cred.json -d //path/to/report-directory
```

results in these actions:
1. Ingests a building configuration file.
2. Generates guids for every entity instance in the building configuration 
   file and re-writes building configuration file in the new format.
3. Validates the building configuration file with the instance validator.
4. Validates the telemetry payloads for each reporting entity in the building 
   configuration file.
5. Writes instance and telemetry validation results to the report directory as 
   `//path/to/report-directory/instance_validation_report.txt` and `//path/to/report-directory/telemetry_validation_report.json`.

**NOTE:** The new building configuration format requires that entities are keyed by Version 4 UUIDs (referred to as guids) instead of the code. To convert from old format to the new format, run your building configuration file(.yaml) through the [guid generator](https://github.com/google/digitalbuildings/tree/master/tools/guid_generator).
