# GUID Generator

The GUID Generator allows you to generate GUIDs for Building Configuration
instances having missing or partially filled GUID fields.

## Setup

To instantiate the generator and its dependencies, run
`sudo python setup.py install`

The generator cannot be run as a standalone application and must be run with the
[toolkit](../toolkit.py).
