  Data provided for this class and its subclasses is expected to be entered as
  it would be seen in a valid building config file.  This means that there will
  be some ambiguity about what the data means without context (ex: one does not
  know if a field is local or global until one knows the namespace of the
  entity's type).  In the case of a partial update, validation will not
  necessarily be able to resolve all ambiguities (ex: if the user does not
  provide the entity's type).  This is an expected limitation.
