# This file contains most of the ways in which numeric fields can be incorrectly formatted. These
# errors are (in order):
# - The default value range map does not have exactly 2 entries.
# - A default range value cannot be parsed as a double.
# - The default value range map has an invalid key.
# - The default value range map does not have exactly one min key, "flexible_min" or "fixed_min",
#   and one max key, "flexible_max" or "fixed_max".
# - The max value is less than or equal to the min value.
