# Digital Buildings Project

The Digital Buildings project is an open-source, Apache-licensed effort to create a uniform schema and toolset for representing structured information about buildings and building-installed equipment.  A version of the Digital Buildings ontology and toolset is currently being used by Google to manage buildings in its portfolio. 

The Digital Buildings project originated from the need to manage a very large, heterogeneous building portfolio in a scalable way. The project aims to enable management applications/analyses that are trivially portable between buildings.  This goal is achieved through a combination of semantically-expressive abstract modeling, an easy-to-use configuration language, and robust validation tooling.  Digital Buildings work has been inspired by [Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/tag) and [BrickSchema](https://brickschema.org/), and maintains cross-compatibility and/or convergence as a long-term objective.

In creating the Digital Buildings project, we have considered the following:

* Human Readability
* Machine readability and interpretation
* Composable functionality
* Dimensional Analysis
* Correctness validation
* Cross compatibility

## Project Structure

This project is structured as following:
*  An [**ontology**](/ontology/README.md) that defines the parameters of the semantic data model and tools for building, validating and associating real equipment with a specific model. It contains the following formats:
   * [Yaml format](/ontology/yaml/README.md)
   * [RDF/OWL format](/ontology/rdf/README.md)
* Tools which allow the following:
  * [Yaml Validator](/tools/validators/ontology_validator/README.md) which allows to validate the yaml ontology upon a change or an extension.
  * [RDF/OWL Generator](/tools/rdf_generator/README.md) which allows to generate an RDF version from the yaml ontology files.

## Internal Building Representation (IBR) File Format

IBR implements single file format that can be adapted to multiple use cases in any building.

Data in different verticals such as spatial, assets, and ontology often come from different source systems. This presents a challenge when a developer wants ensure updated data in downstream systems, especially when they want to combine data across multiple verticals. IBR is a solution that allows all of it to be combined in a meaningful, portable way.

IBR has no opinion of data requirements. If a developer wants to use IBR as an asset tracking tool, they can utilize the Objects message. If they later want to map asset locations to a single floor, that is possible by including a Layers message while updating the Objects messages with location data. If they want to track assets with relation to specific space classes, then they can add that data at a later stage without making a breaking change.

IBR comes with a rendering library built on THREE.js that can be used to easily create a custom UI to visualize and edit the compact data. This allows developers to build custom features and have more control over their tooling.
