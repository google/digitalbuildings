# Digital Buildings Project

The Digital Buildings project is an open-source, Apache-licensed effort to create a uniform schema and toolset for representing structured information about buildings and building-inatalled equipment.  A version of the Digital Buildings ontology and toolset is currently being used by Google to manage buildings in its portfolio. 

The Digital Buildings project originated from the need to manage a very large, heterogeneous building portfolio in a scalable way. The project aims to enable management applications/analyses that are trivially portable between buildings.  This goal is achieved through a combination of semantically-expressive abstract modeling, an easy-to-use configuration language, and robust validation tooling.  Digital Buildings work has been inspired by [Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/tag) and [BrickSchema](https://brickschema.org/), and maintains cross-compatibility and/or convergence as a long-term objective.  

In creating the Digital Buildings project, we have considered the following:

* Human Readability
* Machine readability and interpretation
* Composable functionality
* Dimesional Analysis
* Correctness validation
* Cross compatibility

The project consists of an [**ontology**](./ontology/ontology.md) that defines the parameters of the semantic data model and tools for building, validating and associating real equipment with a specific model.
