# Digital Buildings Project

The Digital Buildings project is an open-source, Apache-licensed effort to create a uniform schema and toolset for representing structured information about buildings and building-installed equipment. A version of the Digital Buildings ontology and toolset is currently being used by Google to manage buildings in its portfolio. 

The Digital Buildings project originated from the need to manage a very large, heterogeneous building portfolio in a scalable way. The project aims to enable management applications/analyses that are trivially portable between buildings.  This goal is achieved through a combination of semantically-expressive abstract modeling, an easy-to-use configuration language, and robust validation tooling.  Digital Buildings work has been inspired by [Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/tag) and [BrickSchema](https://brickschema.org/) and maintains cross-compatibility and/or convergence as a long-term objective.

In creating the Digital Buildings project, we have considered the following:

* Human Readability
* Machine readability and interpretation
* Composable functionality
* Dimensional Analysis
* Correctness validation
* Cross compatibility

## Project Structure

This project is structured as follows:
*  An [**ontology**](/ontology/README.md) that defines the parameters of the semantic data model (Terminology box) and tools for building, validating, and associating real equipment with a specific model. It contains the following formats:
   * [Yaml format](/ontology/yaml/README.md)
   * [RDF/OWL format](/ontology/rdf/README.md)
* [Building Configuration](/ontology/docs/building_config.md) which contains a mapping between the ontology and the "raw" data. Building Config is the Assertion Box.
* Tools that allow the following:
  * [Yaml Validator](/tools/validators/ontology_validator/README.md) which allows to validate the yaml ontology upon a change or an extension.
  * [RDF/OWL Generator](/tools/rdf_generator/README.md) which allows to generate an RDF version from the yaml ontology files.
* [Internal Building Representation](/ibr/README.md) (IBR) File Format to represent data from different verticals such as spatial, assets.

## Learning Modules
The learning modules provide an overview of:
* The main concepts of the Digital Buildings Ontology.
* How to model and extend types.
* The Building configuration file concepts.
* The validation tools for the Building Configuration file.
