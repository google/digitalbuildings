# Digital Buildings Ontology

The Digital Buildings ontology is an open-source, Apache-licensed development effort to create a uniform schema for representing metadata in Google's buildings real estate portfolio. It is inspired by [Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/tag) and [BrickSchema](https://brickschema.org/).

This repository tracks the main schema development of the Digital Buildings Ontology.

## Ontology

The ontology description and organization is [here](./ontology/ontology.md).

The ontology is released in two formats:

* RDF: An RDF class hierarchy describing the various building subsystems and the entities and equipment therein A minimal, principled set of relationships for connecting these entities together into a directed graph representing a building A method of encapsulation for composing complex components from a set of lower-level ones. The rdf content can be found [here](/ontology/rdf)

* Yaml: An equivalent yaml representation of the RDF version for non-RDF experts. The yaml content can be found [here](/ontology/yaml)
