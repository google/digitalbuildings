# RDF OWL
Contains the ontology expressed in [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) format.

The format is generated from the Yaml version using the [RDF/OWL Generator](/tools/rdf_generator/README.md)

An example of how to use the RDF ontology to instantiate a building and its components using code generation is provided in the [example folder](./example/README.md).
