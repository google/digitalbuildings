## Type Definition
Hydronic chilled and condensing water systems are two distinct systems. A typical chilled water system (CHWS) consists of chillers (that use refrigerant to cool a closed loop of circulating water known as the "chilled water") and pumps to distribute the chilled water to other equipment in the building and/or to circulate water through the chillers. Typically, air-side equipment (e.g., AHU, FCU) contains chilled water coils connected to the main CHWS; as air passes over the chilled water coils it is cooled. As chilled water systems cool the chilled water, they must reject the heat absorbed from the chilled water loop. In a CHWS with "air-cooled" chillers, the heat is rejected directly into the atmospehre. In a CHWS with "water-cooled" chillers, the heat is rejected to another water distribution system (typically a condensing water system).

Condensing water systems (CDWS) serve those mechanical devices which rely on water-source heat rejection. Typical condensing water systems consist of open-air cooling towers (which reject the heat absorbed from the condensing water into the atmosphere) and pumps to circulate the condensing water between the cooling towers and the condenser side of a water-cooled chiller.

There are many different types of chilled and condenser water system configurations; some common examples include the following:
- **Constant volume:** the system pumps run at a constant speed to provide fixed flowrates at pre-defined stages (predominantly on condensing water systems)
- **Variable-primary:** there is a single (primary) loop between the chillers and the end-devices and the system pumps operate at variable speed (typically controlling to a differential pressure setpoint)
- **Primary/Secondary:** there are two separate loops, with the primary loop serving as the "production" loop (the chillers) and the secondary loop serving as the distribution loop (to downstream end-devices).

## Type Requirements
- Chillers (CH) require the mechanical cooling of water.
- Condensers require that, regardless of their own cooling method (sensible or evaporative), they serve downstream devices which require water as a condensing source.
- Heat exchangers (HX) provide heat transfer between two fluid streams, without intermixing the fluids. They are modeled separately only if they are stand-alone devices. 

## Connection Requirements
- The equipment which is part of each system should be assigned a `HAS_PART` connection to it.
- The specific interconnections between equipment in the system can also be defined through `FEEDS` connections. In these cases, it is best to feed from the pumps.
- To simplify distribution specifics, the system (rather than the system pumps) should be used to feed downstream equipment.

## Example: Variable Primary CHWS (Air-Cooled) 
This version of CHWS has a single set of variable speed pumps which serve air-cooled chillers and downstream equipment.

### BMS Example

**Notes:**
- The fields associated with individual devices (e.g., individual chiller commands) get mapped to those devices; system level telemetry (e.g., the system return water temperature) gets assigned to the system directly.

## Example: Variable Primary CHWS (Water-Cooled) 
This version of CHWS has a single set of variable speed chilled water pumps serving water-cooled chillers and downstream equipment. The condensing side serves the chillers via two pumps.

### BMS Example
![CHWS Variable Primary WC](./figures/bms_screenshots/chws_watercooled.png)
**Notes:**
- This example includes a parallel air-cooled chiller. It is simple enough to add; it doesn't change the way the rest of the system is modeled.
