# Digitalbuildings Ontology

This section of the digitalbuildings tree contains configuration files and documentation for the digitalbuildings model. 

The model is provided in two versions: 
*    A [yaml](/ontology/yaml/README.md) version that is the primary configuration source
*    A generated [RDF](/ontology/rdf/README.md) version

Documentation for the model can be found in the [docs](docs/) folder.  
*   [Ontology Overview](/ontology/docs/ontology.md) provides an overview of the structure and first principles of the ontology
*   [Ontology Configuration](/ontology/docs/ontology_config.md) explains how to write and validate the .yaml configuration files
*   [Model](/ontology/docs/model.md) describes the convcentions used in the provided abstract model
*   [Building Configuration](/ontology/docs/building_config.md) describes the confguration format for mapping concrete assets to a model and 
validating the mapping

## Learning Modules
The learning modules provide an overview of:
* The main concepts of the Digital Buildings Ontology.
* How to model and extend types.
* The Building configuration file concepts.
* The validation tools for the Building Configuration file.
