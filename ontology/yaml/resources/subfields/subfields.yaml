  sensor: "Component used to measure some quality of a system or process. In some instances, it can be feedback for an analog command (e.g., speed_percentage_sensor is the feedback from speed_percentage_command)."
  setpoint: "Control target of process or system."
  status: "The multistate value indicating an observed state in a piece of equipment, often indicating if a command was effected. It is a neutral observation (i.e., no quality judgment of 'good' or 'bad'). It also has no units of measurement; therefore, if combined with a measurement subfield, it will indicate that the field is the directional status based on some measurement of that type (e.g., power_status equates to an on/off value based on some inference of power)."
  specification: "The specified design value for a particular operating condition (e.g., differential pressure specification)."
  timestamp: "An instant in time, represented as a numeric offset from the epoch."
