MATCHES: Two or more things match.
SUBSCRIPTION_FAILED: The calendar events subscription has failed.
UNKNOWN: The state is unknown.
WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE: The calendar events synchronization process is awaiting response.

# Added for measured statues (e.g. flowrate_status)
PRESENT: "Something is currently materialized physically (e.g. flowrate_status is present)."
ABSENT: "Something is currently not materialized (e.g. flowrate_status is absent). "

ASYNCHRONOUS: "Mode of operation of inverter where either the bypass supply fails or the inverter is not in line bypass voltage and frequency"
SOFTSTART: "Mode of operation of rectifier where the input power supply is gradually turned on to avoid overloading"
NORMAL: "Function, state or flow which is an ideal or expected condition."
REVERSED: "Function, state or flow which is opposed to the expected or normal condition."
