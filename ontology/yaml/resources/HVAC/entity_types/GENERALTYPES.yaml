VAV:
  id: "6599610325710929920"
  description: "Tag for terminal units with variable volume control. A VAV is an air distribution terminal, 
    which is not responsible for its own primary airflow (i.e. it is served by some upstream unit, such as
    an AHU)."
  is_abstract: true
  implements:
  - EQUIPMENT
  opt_uses:
  - zone_use_label # Needed until the zones can are joined to assets with connections.

FAN:
  id: "13300966571238227968"
  description: "Tag for stand-alone fans. This is distinct from integral fans (i.e. fans contained within another
    device, such as an AHU). They transfer air from one space to another, or to ambient. They are unidirectional."
  is_abstract: true
  implements:
  - EQUIPMENT

FCU:
  id: "16867817476115660800"
  description: "Tag for fan-coil units. Fan coil units are distinguished from other air-side devices by the fact
    that they solely handle recirculated space air (they do not directly control their outside air, which
    separates them from AHUs)."

  description: "Tag for air-handling units. AHUs are devices which handle air distribution (either to a single
    space or to multiple via ductwork), and they have the capability of handling both return and outside air,
    in some combination (0% OA, 100% RA; 50% OA, 50% RA; 100% OA, 0% RA, etc.); that is, they can recirculate
    or ventilate. They are distinct from other devices in key ways: FCUs, which handle only recirculated air; 
    MAUs, which handle only outside air; and DOAS devices, which handle outside and return air, but which do 
    not recirculate air. "

    a mechanical room) and supplies downstream VAVs or serves a zone directly. They are not responsible
    directly for the amount of outside air they recieve, but are indirectly responsible for ventilation
